#### Video Demo: <URL HERE>

#### Description:

Women's Network (WN) is a platform for professional and personal development tailored towards women of the global community. The app is designed in Figma and developed with Vue.js and Firebase; it requires knowledge of the latter development tools. The aim of Women's Network is to provide a platform for networking, inspiration and sharing ideas through insightful blog posts made by WN registered users.

People are able to read blog posts, register on the platform, as well as become admins to write and publish new articles - edit them, add images or videos and delete if needed. There are three main pages: Home, Blogs and Register/ Login.

Home contains a welcome part, as well as featured and recent blog posts. Blogs section displays all of the posts on Women's Network. It is possible to open each blog post and read the full article. Blog posts include date added and for admins an option to edit posts. At the section Register/ Login there is a standard registration form and information is connected to the Firebase database. Once registered the user is able to login and if the password is forgotten an option to reset it automatically is also an option offered by Firebase.

Women's Network is a modern and minimalistic idea sharing tool with a smooth and responsive user experience.

## If you debated certain design choices, explaining why you made them:

Some design choices include the use of colours: dark-blue and violet-red. Font is Poppins - it goes for a minimalistic and modern look with simple, clean lines. In my design, I made specific color choices to convey particular values and emotions.

Dark-blue in the design symbolizes trust and dependability because dark blue is associated with stability, trust, and dependability. It is a common choice for corporate designs and financial institutions as it evokes a sense of security and professionalism. Additionally, dark blue promotes feelings of calmness and serenity, being a cool color that helps to soothe and relax the viewer. Furthermore, dark blue is linked to intelligence and expertise, making it an excellent choice for industries that want to emphasize their knowledge and competence.

Violet-red in the design symbolizes creativity and innovation because violet-red is a color that stands out and is often associated with creativity and innovation. It can be used to draw attention and signal that something is unique or imaginative. This color also evokes feelings of passion, energy, and enthusiasm, being a warm color that inspires action and excitement. Moreover, violet-red has a rich, luxurious quality that conveys sophistication and elegance, often associated with high-end products and services.

By using dark-blue and violet-red in the design, I aimed to balance the stability and professionalism of dark-blue with the creativity and energy of violet-red. This creates a dynamic yet trustworthy aesthetic that appeals to a broad audience, suggesting a blend of reliability with innovative flair.

Note: Copilot was used to assist smoother writing and help with answering harder questions for debugging.
